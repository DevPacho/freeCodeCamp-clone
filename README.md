# freeCodeCamp clone!

This is my first approach to the open-source front-end JavaScript library [React! ⚛️](https://github.com/facebook/react).

## Development 🤔

This project is a clone of the **"testimonials"** section of the original [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) website.
It was made in order to learn the basic concepts of React to introduce me more and more in this wonderful technology that I want to include in my future.

## Result 👀
